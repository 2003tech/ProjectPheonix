# Project Pheonix
Project Pheonix: The collaborative open-source website, arising from the ashes of 2003page.

## Why was this created?
Honestly, 2003page was beginning to be doomed in Febuary/March 2020, with the drama and redesign which didn't fitted the "2003" in "2003page", from that time, iirc, 3 contributors, which were the lastest in joining 2003page, left, with no other contributors to be seen.

This was when i decided to shutdown 2003page and a day later, launch Project Pheonix, originally planned to be named "2004page". If you want the true 2003page magic, i'd suggest RetroSite, which was launched after the failure of one of the redesigns by TLWXPUser.
