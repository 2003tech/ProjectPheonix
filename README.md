Project Pheonix: The collaborative open-source website, arising from the ashes of 2003page.

## Why was this created?
Honestly, 2003page was beginning to be doomed in Febuary/March 2020, with the drama and redesign which didn't fitted the "2003" in "2003page", from that time, iirc, 3 contributors, which were the lastest in joining 2003page, left, with no other contributors to be seen.

This was when i decided to shutdown 2003page and a day later, launch Project Pheonix, originally planned to be named "2004page". If you want the true 2003page magic, i'd suggest RetroSite, which was launched by TLWXPUser after a failed redesign on 2003page.
