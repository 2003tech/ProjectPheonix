<h1>Hey! You're on the second IE Test!</h1>
<p>This test is for IE 2, the second version of IE!</p>
<p> This tests IE 2 advanced functionality, with some things that werent really supported with IE 1.5. (The IE 1.5 test WAS supposed to have a picture, but I was too dumb to notice that YOU NEED TO PUT AN ACTUAL URL IN THE img=src stuff, and not a local picture.)</p>
<MARQUEE DIRECTION=LEFT>IE 2 finally supports marquees!</MARQUEE>
<MARQUEE DIRECTION=RIGHT>Thanks for Retrosites marquee!</MARQUEE>
