The PF94 subsite, taken straight out of 2003page! 


It has a interesting history, the subsite was unavailable for a great chunk of 2003page's livespan, due to planned redesigns that went nowhere. It was also the successor to the ill' fated gamerappa.ga (aka That Gamerappa Site, circa Febuary 2017).

The concept art was made in paint.net, and due to my skills not being that great (and i was using Frontpage, as it was made back at 2003page), it doesn't look what i intended it to be. However, i might do a major revamp to the subsite in the near future.
