<title>My review on Dolphin 2.0</title>

<h1>A Dolphin 2.0 Review.</h1>
<p>
      <font face="arial black" color="#000000">Dolphin 2.0 is a great version of the Dolphin emulator, but it has many flaws. It has graphical issues in the GUI when opening a game, and it has many slowdowns. It only has DX9/D3D9 and that is NOTORIOUS for many problems with games. It is a bad option if you have a XP. The recomended option for XP is Dolphin 3.5 due to It's good support with XP.</font>
