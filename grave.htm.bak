<h1>2003page.ga has been shutdown.</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm ChazizPF94, the CEO of 2003tech (Cloud Software) and Merengue Studios here, I have decided to shutdown 2003page.</p>
<p>Before this shutdown, 2003page lasted for slightly more than a full year. Yes, a full year comprised of ethier drama, or inactivity.</p>
<p>You may ask "CRAPPA, WHY DID YOU SHTUDOWN 203PAPGE?!?!".</p>
<ol>
<li>2003page has gotten a lot of drama from people i won't say their names.</li>
<li>2003page was very poorly managed, for most of it's time, it was managed by me, who didn't had the best decisions, this caused a lot of people to quit.</li>
<li>2003page had too much drama and was forgotten easily. The exact same fate for MessengerGeekia, which was shutdown the month before 2003page.</li>
<li>I begun to move on from projects like those. Their success just are short lived.</li>
</ol>
<p>2003page was going to get another redesign just a day before this shutdown, in this case, the introduction of a sidebar.</p>
<p>I have no plans of reviving 2003page. But, there's alternatives!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://2003tech.github.io/ProjectPheonix/">Project Phoenix</a>, a early site created a day after the shutdown of 2003page by me. It is simillar to 2003page, but is different.</li>
<li><a href="http://retrosite.ga/">Retrosite.ga</a>, a site created in Janaury 2020 by two former 2003page contributors after a terrible 2003page redesign caused by me.</li>
<li><a href="https://forkiesassds.github.io/twtacct/">TWTACCT</a>, a website created just days before 2003page's shutdown by a former 2003page contributor. While this doesn't use the "classic aesthetic" that 2003page and Retrosite uses. It is a more modern version.</li>
<li><a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, this works differently from the other 3, but is far, far more better than 2003page.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>That's all, folks.</em></p>
<p>-ChazizPF94.</p>
